# We are going to pair program a simple Tic Tac Toe game prototype, with the candidate driving.

## Here are the requirements:

 - [x] When the user visits the site, they see an empty tic tac toe board.
 - [x] Moves are made by clicking in desired cell on the board.
 - [x] The user is always O, so they go first.
 - [x] The server plays as X. For the purpose of this prototype, the server plays the first available move, from left to right, top to bottom. This will make testing easy at the end.
 - [x] If the user clicks on an occupied cell, nothing should happen.
 - [ ] The server must determine if the game is over, and report that to the client.
 - [x] After the first request (to load the html/css/js), requests should be async. (AJAX).

 _The candidateâ€™s goal is to create a working prototype, not a polished finished product. The emphasis is on functionality and correctness, not styling._
